CUSTOMER DB

Contact method is a NVARCHAR(20)?  Is this long enough?  or should this be an int referenced to another table?

ORDER DB

Should DeliveryWindow be a Datetime?  Currently is a string
Should CanceledReason relate back to the CancellationReason table?  Should this be an INT for the ID?
Is there a difference between a return reason and a cancelled reason?

ORDERFOOD DB

Taxable bit -- can this be a boolean?  Is this an override for the Taxable bit in the FoodDB that is referenced by FoodID?

OTCMEDICATION DB
Does this need a TYPE field like the FOOD DB has?

PHARMACY DB
Does this need a Fax field like the DELIVERYCOMPANY?
Do we need a Phone field?
